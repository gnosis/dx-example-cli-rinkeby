# DutchX CLI
This project provides a simple script that will allow you to run the CLI for:
* Rinkeby (officially supported testnet)
* Kovan
* Mainnet

> The CLI was created for testing purposes only, so some command might work
> different than expected.
>
> So please [comment any issues](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-cli/issues) with
> the CLI so it can be improved over time.

# Documentation
Checkout the [DutchX Documentation](http://dutchx.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

# Get started with the CLI
**1. Install docker**
* https://docs.docker.com/install/

**2. Clone the CLI scripts**
> If you prefer, you can just download the
> [ZIP file](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-cli/archive/master.zip) instead of
> cloning the git repository.

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/gnosis/dx-cli.git dx-cli
cd dx-cli
```

**3. Create `local.conf` using [local.conf.example](./local.conf.example)**
> This step can be omitted if we plan to use the CLI for read-only operations.

Create a duplicate [local.conf.example](./local.conf.example) and call the new
file `local.conf`.

Edit the file in order to add your own secret mnemonic that will be used to sign
the transactions.

> **NOTE**: The `local.conf` is git ignored, so you can add your wallet config
> here.

> **IMPORTANT**: Never share this file or the mnemonic with anyone, the mnemonic
> is protecting your funds from your account, so anyone with access to it could
> take them.

**4. Make sure the scripts are executable**
```bash
# Allow the CLI script to be executed
chmod +x dutchx*
```

**5. Network info: Review the list of tokens you want to use**

For each network, check it's config:
* [network-rinkeby.conf](./network-rinkeby.conf)
* [network-kovan.conf](./network-kovan.conf)
* [network-mainnet.conf](./network-mainnet.conf)

This step is important, because DutchX ist's just a protocol, anyone can list
their tokens, every user should add the token that he want to use with the CLI.

Check the complete list of tokens that are added in the `DutchX`:
* **Rinkeby**: The easiest way to check all token pairs that were added to the
  DutchX is to check the API:
  * [https://dutchx-rinkeby.d.exchange/api/docs/#!/markets/getMarkets](https://dutchx-rinkeby.d.exchange/api/docs/#!/markets/getMarkets)
* **Mainnet**: The easiest way to check all token pairs that were added to the
    DutchX is to check the API:
  * [https://dutchx.d.exchange/api/docs/#!/markets/getMarkets](https://dutchx.d.exchange/api/docs/#!/markets/getMarkets)
* **Kovan**: Unlike `Rinkeby` and `Mainnet`, `Kovan` does't have any API
  published. To check all available markets, you must do it at smart contract level:
  * https://dutchx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/smart-contracts_addresses.html

**6. Try the CLI**

Run the `help` command to get a list of all avaliable commands:
```bash
# Rinkeby
./dutchx-rinkeby help

# Kovan
./dutchx-kovan help

# Rinkeby
./dutchx-mainnet help
```

Example of `local.conf`:

```bash
MNEMONIC="myth like bonus scare over problem client lizard pioneer submit female collect"
MARKETS=WETH-RDN
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=https://rinkeby.infura.io
NETWORK=rinkeby
```

# Basic usage
## Get account balances
Get balances for all tokens of an account
```bash
# Show the balances of the first account of the MNEMONIC
./dutchx-rinkeby balances

# You can ask for the balances of any other account
./dutchx-rinkeby balances --account=The desired account
```
## Get token list
Get all avaliable tokens in the DX
```bash
./dutchx-rinkeby tokens
```

## Get markets
Get all the token pairs in the DX
```bash
./dutchx-rinkeby markets
```

## State of the auction
Get information about the current auction of a given token pair.
```bash
./dutchx-rinkeby state WETH-RDN
```

## Get price
There are several prices, depending on what we need:

```bash
# Current price of an ongoing auction
#   This price is the price biders use (it's going down)
#   A N/A means there is no price (i.e. an auction that didn't run, so  you
#   cannot bid).
./dutchx-rinkeby price WETH-RDN

# Price in USD for a number of tokens
#   It will use the closing price and the Ether oracle
./dutchx-rinkeby usd-price 1 RDN

# Closing prices
#   It'll show the last N closing prices
./dutchx-rinkeby closing-prices WETH-RDN


# Price of an external exchange (i.e. 'binance', 'huobi', 'kraken', 'bitfinex')
#   This is not part of the DX. It's just a reference.
./dutchx-rinkeby market-price WETH-RDN
```

## Get auctions
Show the information of the auctions that cleared in a given period of time.

Filter by dates:

```bash
# Get todays auctions
./dutchx-rinkeby auctions --period today

# Get last 7 days auctions
./dutchx-rinkeby auctions --period week

# Get this week's auctions
./dutchx-rinkeby auctions --period week

# Get last week's auctions
./dutchx-rinkeby auctions --period last-week

# Get auctions between two dates
./dutchx-rinkeby auctions --from-date=25-05-2018 --to-date=26-05-2018
```

You can export the result into a CSV file (it'll include some extra info):
```bash
# Export the result to a file
./dutchx-rinkeby auctions --from-date=25-05-2018 --to-date=26-05-2018 --file=auctions.csv
```

## Get trades

Show the information of the trades that were executed in a given period of time.

```bash
# Get todays auctions
./dutchx-rinkeby trades --period today

# Get last 7 days auctions
./dutchx-rinkeby trades --period week

# Get this week's auctions
./dutchx-rinkeby trades --period week

# Get last week's auctions
./dutchx-rinkeby trades --period last-week

# Get auctions between two dates
./dutchx-rinkeby trades --from-date=25-05-2018 --to-date=26-05-2018
```

Aditionally, you can applu any of this filters:
```bash
# Filter by token
#   It will filter by trades of auctions that contain the given token
./dutchx-rinkeby trades --period today --token RDN

# Filter by sell token
#   It will filter by trades of auctions that contain the given token as a sell
#   token
./dutchx-rinkeby trades --period today --token RDN

# Filter by buy token
#   It will filter by trades of auctions that contain the given token as a buy
#   token
./dutchx-rinkeby trades --period today --token RDN

# Filter by auction index
#   It will filter by trades of auctions that contain the given token as a buy
#   token
./dutchx-rinkeby trades --period today --auction-index 24

# Filter by account
#   It will filter by trades of the given account address
./dutchx-rinkeby trades --period today --auction-index 24
```

You can export the result into a CSV file (it'll include some extra info):
```bash
# Export the result to a file
./dutchx-rinkeby trades --from-date=25-05-2018 --to-date=26-05-2018 --file=auctions.csv
```

# Trade in the DX
To be able to trade, you have to provide your own `mnemonic`. Please,
**[Step 3 in the Configure the CLI]**(https://github.com/gnosis/dx-cli#get-started-with-the-cli).

## Send tokens
This method is not part of the DX, but it cames handy for testing.

It will send tokens ERC20 from one account to another.

```bash
# Send 0.8 RDN to a given account
./dutchx-rinkeby send 0.8 RDN 0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57
```

# Deposit and Withdraw
You can deposit tokens and withdraw them by using the following commands:

```bash
# Deposit WETH
#   It will wrap Ether automatically if you don't have enough WETH balance
./dutchx-rinkeby deposit 0.35 WETH

# Deposit any other token
#   Same way :)
./dutchx-rinkeby deposit 12 RDN


# Withdraw
./dutchx-rinkeby withdraw 0.35 WETH
./dutchx-rinkeby withdraw 12 RDN
```

# Trade in the DX
```bash
# Sell
#   Sell 0.1 WETH in the next WETH-RDN auction
./dutchx-rinkeby sell 0.1 WETH-RDN

# Buy
#   Buy 12 RDN in the current auction
./dutchx-rinkeby buy 12 WETH-RDN

# Claim the seller tokens
#   Once the auction clears
./dutchx-rinkeby claim-seller WETH-RDN

# Claim the buyer tokens
#   Once the auction clears
./dutchx-rinkeby claim-buyer WETH-RDN
```
